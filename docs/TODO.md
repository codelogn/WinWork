# WinWork â€” Current TODO

This document tracks progress on the Settings theme fixes and related work. It is kept in sync with the agent-managed todo list.

## Completed

- Check compile diagnostics for `SettingsWindow.xaml.cs` â€” completed. Build verified and XAML partials generated.
- Verify XAML â†” code-behind wiring (`x:Class`, named elements) â€” completed.
- Build the UI project (`dotnet build`) â€” completed; build succeeds (warnings only).
- Implement minimal safe fixes where necessary â€” completed for the initial pass (added theme helpers and visual-tree update routines).
- Run the app and verify primary theme behavior â€” completed; most form fields updated correctly after changes.
- Update docs/TODO.md and add Copilot guidance file â€” completed (this file + `.github/COPILOT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`).

## In progress

- Make all form fields theme-aware â€” many controls updated, but some submenu items and the Theme combobox still need targeted fixes. (See pending items below.)

## Pending / Next

1. Fix TreeView / submenu items that remain white in Light theme
   - Targets: Data & Storage submenu, Advanced submenu items.
   - Approach: Reproduce in running app, identify the factory/template creating those elements, and update to use `GetForegroundBrush()` / `GetControlBackgroundBrush()` or adjust templates.

2. Make Theme ComboBox visuals opaque in Light theme
   - Ensure the Theme selection ComboBox and its dropdown use an opaque Background and appropriate Foreground/BorderBrush in Light mode.

3. Ensure saved theme is applied reliably on reopen
   - If the settings service initializes asynchronously, apply saved theme on `Window.Loaded` or after settings are available; re-apply and refresh content.

4. Add a lightweight QA checklist or small UI tests for theme switching
   - Manual steps or small automated checks to verify switching Light â†” Dark updates all Settings controls and persists selection across restarts.

## Notes

- Editor/language-server sometimes shows stale errors (e.g., "InitializeComponent does not exist"). These were editor sync issues â€” full `dotnet build` is authoritative and succeeded.
- XAML template binding pitfalls: prefer binding to `TextBlock.Foreground` for ContentPresenter text rather than `Foreground` on ContentPresenter, which may cause XAML compile errors.

If you'd like, I can continue now and implement one of the pending items (pick 1: TreeView repair, 2: Theme ComboBox visuals, 3: apply theme on Loaded, or All).
